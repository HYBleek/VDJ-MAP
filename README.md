# VDJ-MAP
MDS-TFIDF-UMAP Visualization Tool for V(D)J DNA Data
This repository implements an innovative visualization tool for VDJ DNA data analysis by integrating advanced algorithms including Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS), Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP). By combining these techniques, the tool effectively maps high-dimensional VDJ sequence data onto a lower-dimensional space, allowing researchers to visually explore and interpret the complex relationships between sequences against a specific DNA reference.

Key features include:

Dimensionality Reduction: Leveraging MDS and UMAP to preserve both local and global structures within the data.
Text-Based Analysis: Applying TF-IDF to capture important sequence features and relative abundances.
Biological Insights: Enabling the identification of underlying patterns and clusters in VDJ gene usage for deeper immunological analysis.
This toolkit aims to facilitate more intuitive data exploration and hypothesis generation in immune repertoire studies.
